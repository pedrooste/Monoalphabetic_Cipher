<h1>Monoalphabetic_Cipher</h1>
Encrypts a user input based on a Monoalphabetic Cipher<br><br>

<h3>Letter Frequency! (1st trial)</h3>
  
Within this method, we try to decrypt the cipher purely by letter frequency by matching up each characters frequency to the corresponding statistics. This follows a very basic algorithm, confirming a character based on whether the character has a distinct frequency.<br><br>
  
<h3>The Results!</h3>

Whilst this was able to make a good amount of guesses with larger paragraphs (usually above 10!!), the successfull nature of the guesses was low, usually below 20%. A new method must be developed with a higher success rate as this method will only jumble the message more
