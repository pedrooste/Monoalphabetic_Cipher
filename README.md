<h1>Monoalphabetic_Cipher</h1>
Encrypts a user input based on a Monoalphabetic Cipher<br><br>

<h3>Elimination! (2nd trial)</h3><br>
Within this method, we try to decrypt the cipher using letter frequency as a basis, using 5 close neighbours of what the letter could possibly be. We then look at common 1,2,3,4 letter words 
and determine whether these characters are possible characters are present within these combinations. If the letter is not possible, it will be eliminated from the possible list of characters.
This can be seem similar to soduku, where elimination is used to determine where the location of each number is present. <br>

<h3>The Results!</h3>
We shall see...
