Very basic data dictionary.

Structure: Vname, datatype, desc, automated, extra

CipherEncryption:
Scanner		object			static scanner
encrypt		object			encrypt class object
decrypt		object			decrypt class object


Encryption:
message		String			User entered message				user based
cipher		String			Encrypted message				automated based on key
alpha		AL Char			Alphabet					hardcoded
key		AL Char			Mapped Key					Randomly generated
rand		Random obj		Static object

Decryption:
FreqStat	AL LetterFreq obj	Contains freq statistic				hardcoded
singLetter	AL String		Contains common words				hardcoded
twoLetter	AL String		contains common words				hardcoded
cipher		AL String		copy of encryption cihper			automated on encryption		seperated into a list of words	
guessed cipher	AL String		copy of cipher, using guesses			automated on gusses 		contains dashes that will ultimatly be replaced by guessed words, method works
letterFreq	AL guessedLetter obj	cotains the frequency of guessed letters	automated on user entry		used to generate neighbours

LetterFrequency:
character	char			character itself				based on letters found
freq		double			frequency found					based on user entry


GuessedLetter extends LetterFrequency:
guessedLetter		char			gussed letter within cipher			default = "-" later replaced	replacement to be implemented, methods all work
possibleCharacters	AL Characters		contains 5 closest letters within freq		automated based on found information
